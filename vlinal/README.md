# WELCOME!

this is a small library I wrote to do matrix multiplication, special thanks to 3blue1brown for his amazing series explaining the topic!

it uses structures to wrap arrays and matrices, this way we can return arrays from functions. This greatly simplifies the code and elegance, but it's not optimal at all.
