# About
This repository contains files I generated whilst learning to interface with OpenGL, kinda like a school laboratory. I followed tutorials online and read other people's to do all of this, I'd like to mention https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenGL_Programming and https://github.com/c2d7fa/opengl-cube specifically.

# Progress and goals
So far I've only followed simple tutorials explaining how to render colored triangles and how to apply transformation matrices to these triangles with the GPU. I've also learned how to make a perspective projection, and the linear algebra needed to represent linear transformations with matrices. I'd like to finish the tutorials on wikibook's basics and scientific arcs and then make a basic 3d modelling tool to make sure I understand everything well.
